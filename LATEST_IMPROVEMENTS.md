# EduTrack AI - Latest Improvements

## 🎨 Markdown Formatting for AI Analysis

### Issue
AI analysis was displaying with raw markdown syntax (`#`, `**`, `*`, etc.) instead of being properly formatted.

### Solution
1. **Added `markdown` Library**: Installed Python markdown package for robust parsing
   ```bash
   uv add markdown
   ```

2. **Created Custom Template Filter**: `edutrack/templatetags/markdown_filters.py`
   - Converts markdown to HTML with extensions (extra, nl2br, sane_lists)
   - Properly handles headings, lists, bold, italic, code blocks, tables
   - Returns safe HTML for rendering

3. **Enhanced CSS Styling**: Beautiful presentation in `repo_detail.html`
   - Purple gradient headings (#667eea)
   - Proper spacing and line heights
   - Code blocks with dark theme
   - Styled tables, blockquotes, and links

### Result
✅ AI analysis now displays with professional formatting
✅ Headings are prominent and color-coded
✅ Lists are properly indented and styled
✅ Code snippets have syntax highlighting support

## 🔢 Performance Score Calculation Fix

### Issue
Performance scores were showing as "5.0" or not being calculated at all.

### Root Causes
1. Weak regex pattern matching any digit (including "5" from "5.0")
2. Overly restrictive section matching (requiring both "score" AND "performance")
3. No validation of extracted numbers

### Solution
1. **Improved Number Extraction**:
   - Prioritize "X/100" format (e.g., "85/100")
   - Require 2-3 digits for standalone numbers
   - Validate range (0-100)
   - Use word boundaries to avoid partial matches

2. **Better Section Detection**:
   - Flexible OR matching ("score" OR "performance")
   - Additional keyword validation
   - Prevents false positives

3. **Enhanced Prompt**:
   - Explicitly requests numerical format
   - Provides examples ("85/100" or "85")
   - Lists specific scoring criteria

4. **Debug Logging**:
   - Track which sections are found
   - Show extracted values
   - Log parsing methods

### Result
✅ Scores accurately extracted from Gemini responses
✅ Handles multiple format variations
✅ Validates scores are in valid range
✅ Better debugging capabilities

## 👥 Contributors Display

### Feature
Display repository contributors in the detail view.

### Implementation
1. **Data Already Available**: GitHub API fetches contributor info
2. **Added Contributors Card**: Shows all contributors with:
   - Avatar images
   - Usernames
   - GitHub profile links
   - Contribution counts
   - Clean, responsive grid layout

### Result
✅ Teachers can see who worked on the project
✅ Identifies collaboration patterns
✅ Links directly to contributor profiles

## 🗑️ Removed README Preview

### Change
Removed the README preview section from repository detail page.

### Reason
- Cluttered the interface
- README content is accessible via GitHub link
- Focus on AI analysis and metrics

### Result
✅ Cleaner, more focused interface
✅ Faster page load
✅ Better user experience

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Logic
1. **`edutrack/api/gemini_handler.py`**
   - Improved score extraction regex
   - Enhanced prompt clarity
   - Added debug logging
   - Better section detection

### Templates
2. **`edutrack/templates/repo_detail.html`**
   - Added markdown_filters template tag
   - Enhanced CSS for AI summary display
   - Added contributors section
   - Removed README preview
   - Improved visual hierarchy

### New Files
3. **`edutrack/templatetags/__init__.py`** - Template tag module
4. **`edutrack/templatetags/markdown_filters.py`** - Markdown to HTML converter
5. **`test_score_extraction.py`** - Score extraction test suite
6. **`docs/SCORE_CALCULATION_FIX.md`** - Detailed fix documentation

### Dependencies
7. **`pyproject.toml`** - Added markdown library

## 🧪 Testing

### Score Extraction Test
```bash
python test_score_extraction.py
```

Expected outputs:
- ✅ "60/100" → Score: 60
- ✅ "85" → Score: 85
- ✅ "Score: 75/100" → Score: 75
- ❌ "5" → Ignored (single digit)

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Analyze a repository
- [ ] Verify score appears correctly (not 5.0)
- [ ] Check AI analysis formatting
- [ ] Confirm contributors display
- [ ] Verify README preview is removed
- [ ] Test on multiple repositories
