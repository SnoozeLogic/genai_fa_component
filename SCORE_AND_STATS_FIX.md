# 🔧 Score and Statistics Display Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Commit Statistics Not Displaying
**Problem:** Assignment detail page was not showing statistics (total students, commits, etc.)

**Root Cause:** Template variables existed but were showing 0 or empty values when there was no data.

**Solution:** Added `|default:"0"` filters to all statistical template variables to ensure they display "0" instead of being blank.

**Files Modified:**
- `edutrack/templates/assignment_detail.html`

**Changes:**
```django
<!-- Before -->
<h3>{{ total_repos }}</h3>

<!-- After -->
<h3>{{ total_repos|default:"0" }}</h3>
```

### 2. ✅ Performance Score Extraction Enhanced
**Problem:** AI-generated performance scores were not being extracted reliably from Gemini responses.

**Root Cause:** Score parsing was too simplistic and didn't handle all response formats.

**Solution:** Implemented multi-level score extraction with fallbacks:
1. Try to find `X/100` pattern first
2. Try `Score: XX` or `Performance Score: XX` patterns
3. Try standalone 2-3 digit numbers
4. If section-based parsing fails, scan the entire response text
5. Validate all scores are in 0-100 range

**Files Modified:**
- `edutrack/api/gemini_handler.py`

**New Features:**
- ✅ Comprehensive regex patterns for various score formats
- ✅ Full-text fallback extraction
- ✅ Detailed debug logging with emojis (✓, ✗, ✅, ❌)
- ✅ Score validation (0-100 range check)

### 3. ✅ Score Saving with Type Validation
**Problem:** Scores might fail to save if wrong type.

**Root Cause:** No type validation before saving to FloatField.

**Solution:** Added try-catch block to convert extracted score to float before saving.

**Files Modified:**
- `edutrack/views.py` (analyze_repo function)

**Changes:**
```python
# Before
repo.performance_score = analysis.get('score')

# After
extracted_score = analysis.get('score')
if extracted_score is not None:
    try:
        repo.performance_score = float(extracted_score)
        print(f"[VIEW DEBUG] ✓ Saved performance_score: {repo.performance_score}")
    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
        print(f"[VIEW DEBUG] ✗ Could not convert score: {e}")
        repo.performance_score = None
```

## Debug Logging Added

All score extraction steps now have detailed debug output:

```
[SCORE DEBUG] Found score section: ...
[SCORE DEBUG] ✓ Extracted score from X/100 pattern: 85
[SCORE DEBUG] ✅ Final score: 85
[VIEW DEBUG] ✓ Saved performance_score: 85.0
[VIEW DEBUG] Repository saved. Final performance_score in DB: 85.0
```

This makes it easy to troubleshoot score extraction issues.

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Statistics Display
1. Navigate to assignment detail page
2. You should see:
   - Total Students: (count or 0)
   - Total Commits: (count or 0)
   - Languages Used: (count or 0)
   - Analysis Progress: (percentage)
   - Average Score: (score or "-")

### 2. Test Score Extraction
1. Analyze a repository
2. Check the terminal output for debug logs
3. Verify score appears in:
   - Repository detail page
   - Assignment detail page (average score)
   - JSON response from analyze endpoint

### 3. Verify Database
```bash
uv run python manage.py shell
```

```python
from edutrack.models import StudentRepo
repos = StudentRepo.objects.filter(is_analyzed=True)
for repo in repos:
    print(f"{repo.student_name}: Score = {repo.performance_score}")
```

## Expected Output

### Assignment Detail Page
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📊 Total Students      │ 4         │
│ 📝 Total Commits       │ 67        │
│ 💻 Languages Used      │ 3         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⏺ Analysis Progress    │ 75%       │
│ 📈 Average Score        │ 82.5      │
│ 🏆 Top Performers       │ [list]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Debug Output (Terminal)
```
[SCORE DEBUG] Found score section: 85/100

This project demonstrates...
[SCORE DEBUG] ✓ Extracted score from X/100 pattern: 85
[SCORE DEBUG] ✅ Final score: 85
[VIEW DEBUG] Extracted score from analysis: 85
[VIEW DEBUG] ✓ Saved performance_score: 85.0
[VIEW DEBUG] Repository saved. Final performance_score in DB: 85.0
```

## Score Extraction Patterns Supported

| Format | Example | Extracted |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| X/100 | `85/100` | 85 |
| Score: X | `Score: 85` | 85 |
| Performance Score: X | `Performance Score: 85` | 85 |
| Rating: X | `Rating: 85` | 85 |
| Standalone | `85` (2-3 digits) | 85 |

## Files Changed Summary

1. **edutrack/templates/assignment_detail.html**
   - Added `|default:"0"` to all stat variables
   - Ensures statistics always display

2. **edutrack/api/gemini_handler.py**
   - Enhanced score extraction with multiple regex patterns
   - Added full-text fallback parsing
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Added score validation (0-100 range)

3. **edutrack/views.py**
   - Added type validation before saving score
   - Added debug logging for score saving process
   - Added error handling for score conversion

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Stats show 0 even with data
**Check:** Verify repositories exist in the assignment
```bash
uv run python manage.py shell
```
```python
from edutrack.models import Assignment, StudentRepo
assignment = Assignment.objects.get(id=1)
print(f"Repos: {assignment.repos.count()}")
print(f"Commits: {sum(r.commit_count for r in assignment.repos.all())}")
```

### Issue: Score not extracting
**Check:** Look at terminal debug output when analyzing
- Should see `[SCORE DEBUG]` messages
- If you see `❌ No score could be extracted`, the Gemini response doesn't contain a recognizable score

**Fix:** Check Gemini prompt in `gemini_handler.py` - ensure it asks for "Performance Score (0-100)"

### Issue: Score saving as None
**Check:** Terminal for `[VIEW DEBUG]` messages
- Should see `✓ Saved performance_score: X`
- If you see `✗ Could not convert score`, there's a type issue

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Statistics now display properly with default values
2. ✅ Score extraction is robust with fallbacks
3. ✅ Debug logging helps identify issues
4. 🔄 Monitor terminal output when analyzing repositories
5. 🔄 If scores still don't extract, may need to adjust Gemini prompt

## Performance

- No performance impact from default filters
- Debug logging can be disabled in production by removing print statements
- Score extraction tries patterns in order (fast to slow):
  1. X/100 pattern (fastest)
  2. Score: X pattern
  3. Standalone number (fallback)
  4. Full-text scan (last resort)
