## 🔧 How to Add a Token (Optional)

### Step 1: Generate Token
1. Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "EduTrack AI"
4. Select scope: ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you'll only see it once!)

### Step 2: Add to .env
Edit `.env` file:
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Server
```bash
./start.sh
```

**That's it!** The system will automatically use authenticated access.

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

### Test Without Token (Current):
```bash
uv run python test_github.py

⚠️  Using unauthenticated access (no token)
   Rate limit: 60 requests/hour per IP
✅ PUBLIC REPO ACCESS WORKS!
```

### Test With Token (After adding):
```bash
uv run python test_github.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Using authenticated access (with token)
   Rate limit: 5,000 requests/hour
✅ PUBLIC REPO ACCESS WORKS!
```
